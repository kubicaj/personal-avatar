### 3. Open API

## Local Deployment

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
    RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-api-key>
    ```

2. Run the following command from the project root:

    ```bash
    uv run gradio deploy
    ```

    If prompted again for your Hugging Face token, stop the process (`Ctrl + C`) and instead run:

    ```bash
    uv run dotenv -f ../.env run -- uv run gradio deploy
    ```

    This ensures all required secrets are loaded from your environment.

3. Follow the interactive deployment instructions:
    - App name: `avatar_kubica`
    - Entry file: `app.py`
    - Hardware: `cpu-basic`
    - Supply secrets: **Yes**
    - Provide API keys when prompted
    - GitHub Actions: **No**

    - `HF_TOKEN`

2. Push or merge your changes into the `main` branch.

3. GitHub Actions will trigger the **Deploy Gradio App** workflow automatically. Monitor it to ensure it completes successfully.
